    ------------7.Anonymous Array--------------

    Sometimes we can declare an Array without name such type of name less Array are called Anonymous
    Array.The main purpose of Anonymous array is just for instant use(One Time Usage)

    We can create Anonymous array as  follows:

    new int[]{10,20,30,40}

    While creating Anonymous Array we can not specify the Size otherwise we will get compile time error

    new int[3]{10,20,30} // Not Valid
    new int[]{10,20,30}  // Valid


    We can create Multidimensional Anonymous Arrays also:
    new int[][]{{10,20},{30,40,50}}

    Based on our requirement we can give the name for Anonymous Array then it is no longer
    Anonymous.

    int[] x = new int[]{10,20,30};
